  <div class="sky-subsection-heading">Action button order</div>
  <p>The buttons in a toolbar should always appear in a consistent order. Not all toolbars will have every possible button, but when a button ispresent on a particular toolbar, it should be located in the expected place. The following standard actions should appear in this order fromleft to right when they are included in a toolbar.</p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="sky-subsection-heading">More actions</div>
  <p>Less important or less frequently used actions should go in the more actions menu. Additionally, when there isn't enough horizontal spacefor all of the actions in a given toolbar, the standard actions should collapse into the more actions menu as needed.</p>
  
  <div class="sky-subsection-heading">Find in this list</div>
  <p>When a toolbar needs a search component, it should follow the actions (and more actions button if used). The find in this list is alignedwith the action buttons, so if a user has a really large monitor resolution, it will still appear on the left side of the screen.</p>
  
  <div class="sky-subsection-heading">Items related to views</div>
  <p>The portion of the toolbar that is docked on the right side of the screen is reserved for items that change or affect the view of the rest of the content container in a substantial way. Which items appear for a given toolbar largely depends on how the toolbar is being used. Ifmore than one of these exists in a given toolbar, they show up in this order from left to right.</p>

  <div class="sky-subsection-heading">Toolbar action wrapping</div>
  <p>The actions in a toolbar (including the more actions button) shouldn't extend beyond 50% of the screen. If the actions would extendbeyond 50% of the screen, the rightmost action should collapse into the more actions menu.</p>
  
  <p>If there isn't already a more actions menu in a list that has too many actions to fit, a more actions menu should be created and the tworightmost actions should both be placed in it.</p>
  
  <div class="sky-subsection-heading">Smaller form factors</div>
  <p>Once a screen gets too small, the action buttons should switch to be icon onlybuttons, the find in this list should collapse into a single search icon, and theview switcher should collapse into a single icon as well. Buttons that don't havean icon will need to go in the more actions menu. The more actions button,view switcher, and any other buttons that need to drop down will drop down toshow their options when pressed.</p>
